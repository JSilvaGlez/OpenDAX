OpenDAX (c) 2007 Phil Birkelbach

OpenDAX is an Open Source Distributed Control System.

At this point the code is at best, pre-alpha quality and it is not ready to be 
installed on production systems.

The system is meant to be flexible and scalable, it should utilize the 
strength of the underlying operating system as much as possible.  The modern
Open Source operating system kernels are fantastic pieces of software that 
do their jobs very well.  There is no sense in duplicating any of the
functions that they perform.

With that in mind OpenDAX uses separate processes for modules.  Almost all
of the tasks of the system are handled by these modules.  They interact with
each other through a service that runs on each machine in the system.  Each
module communicates with this server through the libdax library.

The OpenDAX system is intended to provide many different mechanisms for 
modules to communiate with one another.  The details haven't quite been
worked out yet but there are a few requirements that we think must be a 
part of the system.

The system should be network transparent at the module level.

The system should be able to handle all manner of datatypes, including 
arrays and custom designed datatypes.  The data map should be dynamic, able
to grow and shrink as the program runs.

Modules should also be dynamic, able to be loaded and unloaded at runtime 
with no requirement for any central configuration.  It should be possible
for programs that don't even know they are modules to be used as such. 
The server could open pipes to a program's stdin, stdout and 
stderr file descriptors so that they can be manipulated by the DAX.  This 
will probably have limited usefulness but it's conceivable that some
programs could find a place.  One idea that comes to mind would be running
mpg123 for playing alarm sounds.  No sense in writing a custom module to 
play sounds when programs already exist to do the job.  Besides this makes
OpenDAX a good *nix program since it allows modular software to be used
in applications that the original designers never envisioned.

One feature that the system will need that may be quite difficult is 
redundancy.  If the system is truely distributed then it should be capable of
losing network nodes and remain in control.  This is probably going to be
more difficult than any other requirement.  Frankly I don't really know how to
even begin thinking about this requirement.  It seems that some kind of 
syncronization between logic modules and failover of I/O modules would be
needed.  This may be more of a module design issue than a server issue
but it must be considered throughout the design process, so that we don't
paint ourselves into a corner.

Once the server is built and the libraries are functional then all
of the work will take place in the modules.  There would be modules for I/O.
This I/O could be some kind of hardwired I/O, networked I/O using Modbus or
ControlNet.  Even the PC serial or parallel port could be used as I/O.

There would have to be some kind of logic modules.  These could be as simple
as a small Lua script  or something as elaborate as a full featured ladder
logic interpreter.

Other modules would include Alarming, Logging, Trending and some kind of HMI.
The HMI modules could be web based, X11 based or even simple text based
HMIs written with ncurses or readline.

A little note on licensing.  It is very tempting to use programs like bison to
create logic modules or programs like glade to produce HMI modules but these
programs will generate C code that will have to be compiled.  There is nothing
wrong with this but it should be noted that any program that is linked with
the GPL'd libraries of OpenDAX will have to also be distributed under the 
terms of the GPL.  If the logic library were itself an interpreter then the
end user program would be seen more as a configuration and would not have 
to be distributed in source code.  This is probably okay for the vast 
majority of the projects out there but we need to consider the end client 
(the guy that owns the equipment we control) or we will find ourselves 
with a piece of software and no market.

Also the application developer need not be a C programmer.  Very few
control system integrators come up from a computer science background.
Most come from an instrument / electrical background and can learn to
configure systems and write logic, but asking them to be low level
C programmers is asking too much, and they will go elsewhere.

The Free Software Foundation has many good resources to read regarding 
these kinds of issues and it would be beneficial for all users of this 
system to understand the licensing freedoms associated with the GPL.

Okay enough README file stuff.  Back to coding.
