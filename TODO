opendax gets all locked up when a module fails to start

_status tag can be written to by modules.  This should be read only.

Allow 'nice' levels to be set for modules

Finish making the 'libdaxlua' library into a package for Lua scripts.  I need
to finish some initialization and destruction functions as well as write a
little Lua file to go into the LUA_PATH somewhere so the 'require()' function
can be used instead of having to load the library manually.  Also need to
figure out how to find the right place to install this little script to the
right place and have the 'make install' script put it in the right place.

Finish asynchronous event notifiation stuff

Add event driven scripts to daxlua as well as ways for scripts to poll or
select on events.  How to do the callbacks???

Much more testing needs to be done.
