opendax gets all locked up when a module fails to start

_status tag can be written to by modules.  This should be read only.

Allow 'nice' levels to be set for modules

Separate out the dax/lua functions (ie. creating/reading/writing tags, etc).

It would be nice if the libdax library functions were reentrant.  At least they should allow
for more than one connection from one module.  Right now there is static/global data in the
library that keeps this from being possible.  This should be encapsulated into an object that
can be passed back to the module.

The modbus functions need to be placed in thier own library.  All communications modules should
separate out the particulars of the communications into a separate library.  This makes the
program more useful to people even if they don't need the full functionality of the system.
This could also be said of other parts of the system like, ladder logic interpretation, svg
animation etc.

Much more testing needs to be done.
