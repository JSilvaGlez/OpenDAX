\chapter{Handling Events}

Event handling is not part of the system yet.  This is still a work in progress.

\chapter{Messaging to Other Modules}

Module messaging is not part of the system yet.  This is still a work in progress.

\chapter{Shell Modules}
Shell Modules are called that because they are processes that are normally started from the command line shell.  These modules could be anything from an mp3 player to a database client.  They could be just about any program that can be started from the shell prompt.  They obviously don't have any "normal" OpenDAX functionality.  OpenDAX allows their use by letting other modules gain access to the shell modules STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR file descriptors.  Text can be sent from other modules to these shell modules and controlled as though that text was being typed on the command line.  This allows OpenDAX to easily add functionality found in other programs and perhaps not reinvent too many wheels.

Shell modules must be started by the \opendax server.  If you think about it this only makes sense.  If you simply ran them from the command line they would just be the same old programs.  When they are run as children of the \opendax server, the server would have access to the file descriptors that it needs to manipulate these programs.  It becomes a wrapper process for these programs.

These would be configured in \textit{opendax.conf}.
