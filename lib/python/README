This directory contains the python extension module for OpenDAX.

To build it you can use the good 'ol python method of running
the setup.py script...

$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install

There is also a Makefile that automates this somewhat so
you can also use...

$ make
$ make install

The OpenDAX libraries should be installed before you try to build
and install this extension module.
