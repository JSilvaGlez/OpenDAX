Add tag retrieving functions

Possibly add multiple threads with different scripts in each

Once the tag change notifications are programmed into the core we need
a way to call certain scripts with changes in tags.

I should reprogram this so that after the script is loaded we compare all of the
globals to dax tags that already exist.  Then it can make a list of these tags
for each script, read them from opendax and populate the _G table with the right
data, run the script and when it's over write these tags back out to dax.  I'll
keep the existing routines for reading and writing data in case the script writer
wants to do some fancy stuff.  We could also have a notification message when
a tag is added.
