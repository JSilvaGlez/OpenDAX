This file lists the tests that need to be added so that we don't forget.

All manner of Custom Datatype tests need to be done.  Testing for recursive includes of member is very important.
Bad things will happen if we allow one datatype to incude itself.  This is more difficult because a datatype can
be included in a type that includes another datatype that causes the recursion.  This needs to be tested well.

Test that a very large amount of data will transfer correctly.  Enough that multiple messages will be required.
