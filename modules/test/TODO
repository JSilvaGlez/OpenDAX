This file lists the tests that need to be added so that we don't forget.

Still need a read/write test to make sure that data gets transfered back and forth
to the server correctly.  It needs to test all the different datatypes, corner cases
for arrays and CDTs.

Test that a very large amount of data will transfer correctly.  Enough that multiple messages will be required.
