Obviously not all of this has been done in the DAX itself yet.

Need to have a way to store the "mode" of the client so that TAG, DAX, MOD etc would not
have to be retyped everytime.  If DB was typed alone on the command line the it would go
into DB mode and the prompt would change to daxc:DB>.  Then only READ and WRITE would have
to be typed.  Maybe I should also adjust the command detection to use the least number of
letters that would be necessary to denote a command, like the old Cisco OS.
