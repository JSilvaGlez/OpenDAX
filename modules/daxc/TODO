LIST command should accept a single number that tells it to display the next N records. 
As a part of this is should also keep the last record displayed so that it can start there.
If given two numbers it should display the records starting at the first argument using the
second argument as the count.

Maybe I need to rethink this whole thing.  Perhaps it should be...

DAX status
DAX stop
DAX reload

TAG add x x x
TAG list x x
TAG set x x x x
TAG get x x x x

MOD add x x x x
MOD list x x
MOD start x
MOD stop x
MOD status x
MOD connect x  <connect to STDIN / STDOUT with dax CL>

DB list x x x
DB set x x   <maybe read / write would be better for raw access>
DB get x x

MSG send x x

Obviously not all of this has been done in the DAX itself yet.
